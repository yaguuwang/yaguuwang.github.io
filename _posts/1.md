Dear Santa Claus

A sincere "Hi" from me.  Thank you for bring good people their desired gifts in the cold winter. This year I was planning on sending my christmas list to you since I’m really doing a good job so far. However, I found I don’t really need any gift which can be bought from market. So I change christmas list into a goal list for next year. The gift that I want to get from you is your support and supervising.

**My Goal List**

1. Learning new skills
	* Ukulele
	* Japanese
2. Improving skills
	* Programming language: Swift, C++, Java
	* English writing
	* Chinese handwriting
	* Cooking
3. Finding a meaningful internship during summer vacation
4. Having a US driver license and a car
5. Swimming an hour every morning

Thanks again~

Yours
Sheldon
